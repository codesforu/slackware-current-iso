slackware-current-iso
========

As the mainstream hardware is already x86_64, there is no release of installation ISO for x86_32 and the main focus is on slackware64-current.  
Check out the [slackware64-current-iso](https://github.com/codesforu/slackware64-current-iso) repository and read the instruction to see how to build an installation ISO for x86_32 by your self.  
If you want me to update it on demand or you need an x86_32 version, you can open an issue or sponsor me with a server so that I can make it automatic, as well as providing another mirror for Slackware.
